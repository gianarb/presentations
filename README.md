This is my attempt to move out from Google Slides.

Currently I am trying marp as suggested by David (rawkode).

## Foldering

I am sure it will evolve moving forward but I like the idea to have all my
slides at the `root`. Right now for example:

* `2020-test` is my first slide.

The `marp` directory contains the engine and what is required for `marp` to
work. I presume I will use it for a while but I still like the idea to have what
belong to the engine in its own directory.

`bin` contains utility commands.

## marp directory

marp is a npm project, you need to run `cd ./marp && npm install` in order to
get the required dependencies.
